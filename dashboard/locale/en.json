They are mainly found in highly disturbed urban environments. Generally, the higher their proportion at a site, the more it is affected by human activities.",

Eutrophic species are favored by pollution enriched with nitrogen nutrients, mainly related to urban traffic and rural agriculture. A high proportion of eutrophic species often indicates ecological imbalance, signaling that the site is heavily affected by this form of pollution.",

A high LDV suggests less pollution, but other environmental factors such as climate can also influence this index. It is therefore important to consider the ecology of the species present by looking at other indicators, such as the presence of toxitolerant species.
