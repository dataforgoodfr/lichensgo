  "species_number_distribution_hist1_tooltip": "The number of lichen species (or diversity) reflects environmental quality. Generally, more species indicate less pollution. Select a site on the map to see its position (red line) relative to other Lichens GO records (blue bars).",
  "vdl_distribution_hist2_title": "Lichen Diversity Value Distribution",
  "vdl_distribution_hist2_tooltip": "The LDV (lichen diversity value) measures the abundance of lichens at a site. This abundance corresponds to the number of squares in which a species is present. A high LDV suggests less pollution, but other environmental factors such as climate can also influence this index. It is therefore important to consider the ecology of the species present by looking at other indicators, such as the presence of toxitolerant species. Select a site to see its position (red line) compared to other Lichens GO records (blue bars).",

  "toxitolerance_gauge_tooltip": "This indicator shows the proportion of toxitolerant species at the site. Toxitolerant species are generally tolerant to air pollution. They are mainly found in highly disturbed urban environments. Generally, the higher their proportion at a site, the more it is affected by human activities.",
  "eutrophication_gauge_title": "Eutrophic Species (%)",
  "eutrophication_gauge_tooltip": "This indicator shows the proportion of eutrophic species at the site. Eutrophic species are favored by pollution enriched with nitrogen nutrients, mainly related to urban traffic and rural agriculture. A high proportion of eutrophic species often indicates ecological imbalance, signaling that the site is heavily affected by this form of pollution.",
  "acidity_gauge_title": "Acidophilic Species (%)",
  "acidity_gauge_tooltip": "Acidophilic species are favored by acidic pollution. However, this type of pollution has practically disappeared from our cities. Therefore, currently, acidophilic species are rather indicators of an absence of eutrophic pollution.",
